## Considering moving to dwm6.3

I don't know if I'll actually move to the newer version, since I don't know what's new. I'll have it in mind though, it may be
good to update. Or maybe not, since it'd mean I'd have to move all the patches to the newer versions, not even mentioning all my
shortcuts and such. Well, time will tell.

# My DWM build version 6.2

Older build (5.8 I believe) is in the 'old' branch.
Any configuration is and will be made in config.def.h since I miswrote the script to automatize the compilation process.
This obviously WILL be changed, but in a few commits more (like 10 minutes after I write this is going to be as it should be haha)

## Testing branch
In testing I have some non-official patches (not part of the suckless webpage). If you're looking for rainbow tags, you'll able to find
them there.

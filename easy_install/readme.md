Hey! If you're reading this, I'm glad that you're going to install my build.

# Installation (Manual users)
If you know how to install dwm, then the only thing you should do is to copy/link "layoutmenu.sh" into your
binaries

# Installation (automatized)
If you don't know what you're doing and you want to install my build, you can run the "install.sh" script
that's inside this folder. But first, you have to do this:

`cp install.sh ../ 
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
cp layoutmenu.sh $HOME/.local/bin/layoutmenu.sh
`

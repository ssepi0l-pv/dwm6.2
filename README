#My DWM build version 6.2

Older build (5.8 I believe) is in the 'old' branch.
Any configuration is and will be made in config.def.h since I miswrote the script to automatize the compilation process.
This obviously WILL be changed, but in a few commits more (like 10 minutes after I write this is going to be as it should be haha)

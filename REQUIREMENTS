Hey! If you cloned this repo, you'll probably want to install this packages in your sistem (or change the config.h/config.def.h file). I'll make sure to
just add the "important" packages (i.e: I don't think you'll need Zoom Meetings, and if you do, install it yourself!)

For Arch-based users:

pacman -S zim emacs discord alacritty rofi spectacle keepass pavucontrol pamixer amixer mpc mpd ncmpcpp htop

And you'll also need some packages from the AUR:

yay -S nerd-fonts-complete nerd-fonts-dejavu-complete ttf-joypixels light-git 

... I should make a file to pass onto Pacman to do this... yeah... I should...

Nah. Do it yourself! Live bloatless! (but has amixer+pamixer, mpc+ncmpcpp... KEK)

sepi0l-pv OUT!
